Reference: https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.array.php
As of PHP 5.4 you can also use the short array syntax, which replaces array() with [].

If it is not specified, PHP will use the increment of the largest previously used integer key.

braces surrounding arrays within strings allows constants to be interpreted
" {arr[$value]}"
